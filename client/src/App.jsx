      My first course of action should be to create the area where selecting things happens, as well as deciding the rest of the layout.
    I already know I want to make the site utilize minecraft hud elements. For instance, every box I can select I'd like it to use the inventory square look (I'll call them "slots". they'll take in an image and a name, and ). I think the way I'll accomplish that is by tweaking the border and background until it looks pretty similar.
